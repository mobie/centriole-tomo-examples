# Summary

Visualizing the organelle structure in patient-derived tissues at nanoscale can provide insights into numerous pathologies, but existing tools do not allow for analysis of sufficient numbers of cells at the required resolution. Here, by applying a semi-automated high-throughput electron tomography strategy, we quantify structural abnormalities of centrioles in human bone-marrow-derived cells at high numbers and share our data with the cell biological community to illustrate its utility as a tool for structural organelle analysis.
