## Summary

Visualizing the organelle structure in patient-derived tissues at nanoscale can provide insights into numerous pathologies, but existing tools do not allow for analysis of sufficient numbers of cells at the required resolution. Here, by applying a semi-automated high-throughput electron tomography strategy, we quantify structural abnormalities of centrioles in human bone-marrow-derived cells at high numbers and share our data with the cell biological community to illustrate its utility as a tool for structural organelle analysis.


## Opening the dataset in MoBIE

In order to load one of the data-sets in MoBIE, you need to [install the MoBIE Fiji Plugin](https://github.com/mobie/mobie-viewer-fiji#install), select `Plugins->MoBIE->Open->Open MoBIE Project` and enter https://github.com/mobie/centriole-tomo-examples. Or select it from the `Open published project` menu entry.
